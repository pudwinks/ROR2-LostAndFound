If you get softlocked after attempting to go through the teleporter, please save any logs you have and contact me @lukaskawalec or cyanblur @cyanblur on Discord, @lukaskawalec, or on GitHub.

This update most likely does not fix the bug, but it is an attempt.

Thank you to cyanblur for implementing this and wanting it to be merged with LostAndFound!
