# Lost & Found
This mod does work with StageRecap. You might want to turn off the scanner in its config though.

Lost & Found is a mod which pauses time at the end of each stage and gives you a camera view of each interactable you missed.

`!WARNING!` May contain spoilers.
#### *This mod is configurable!*

You can either head to `BepInEx/config/Pudwinks.LostAndFound.cfg` OR use `Risk of Options` to configure it. You get to decide on what to show or hide for the recap, as well as change keybindings to whatever you want.

To use `Risk Of Options`, go to `Settings -> Mod Options -> LostAndFound`.

#### `Risk of Options` *is OPTIONAL. This mod will still work without it.*

You do not need to restart the game to apply the changes using `Risk Of Options`.

## Default keybinds
`Left mouse` to go to the next interactable.

`Right mouse` to go to the previous interactable.

`A` to zoom out the camera.

`D` to zoom in the camera.

`S` to end the recap and resume time.

These are all configurable. Set them to whatever you want - these are just the defaults.
## FAQ
### Does this mod work in multiplayer?
No. It is disabled for multiplayer.
### I'm having issues with, uh, something, I dunno.
I dunno, try deleting the .cfg file and restarting the game. Probably won't help unless it's related to the .cfg.
## How to install manually
If you don't want to use `r2modman` to install this mod, doing it manually is easy.

Put the `.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/{make-a-new-folder}/{put-the-dll-in-this-folder}`. Folder can be called whatever you want it to be called. "`LostAndFound`", "`Pudwinks-LostAndFound`", "`Beans`" to name a few.
